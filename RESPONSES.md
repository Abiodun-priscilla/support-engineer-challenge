#### Community Forum Response

[Hi Mr A,
Response status code 503 generally means the service is unavailable. This could mean that the server can’t handle the requests because of technical issues.

Try to run fly logs and, after that, fly status.
Sometimes it helps fly to update itself, and it runs.

If you are able to share the logs, it will be much easier to find the issue.]
